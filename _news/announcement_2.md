[LIFT Aircraft](https://www.liftaircraft.com/), in partnership with Marubeni Aerospace, plans to launch its unique pay-per-flight eVTOL service in Japan during World Expo 2025. Following successful demonstrations in Osaka and an exhibition at SusHi Tech 2024 in Tokyo, the collaboration marks Japan as the first market outside of the United States where LIFT’s HEXA aircraft will be available to the public. This move comes as Marubeni Aerospace officially places its first purchase order for HEXA, following a pre-order agreement made last year.

Japan will be only the second country where people can experience eVTOL flight training and operation. LIFT initially launched its pay-per-flight eVTOL experiences in the United States in 2023, and now, with Marubeni Aerospace as its operating partner, LIFT Japan will allow the Japanese public to enjoy the HEXA experience firsthand. “We’re excited to deepen our relationship with Marubeni Aerospace and bring LIFT Aircraft to Japan,” said Matt Chasen, Founder and CEO of LIFT Aircraft. “Our demonstrations in Osaka and Tokyo have shown that there is significant demand for personal eVTOL experiences in Japan. Marubeni Aerospace’s operational excellence and reputation make them the perfect partner as we make the dream of flight a reality for people across Japan.”

FLIFT Aircraft has worked with the United States Air Force to test HEXA, showcasing its suitability for both recreational flight and potential public safety applications. The launch of LIFT Japan represents a major expansion of LIFT’s global reach, which aims to make personal, vertical flight accessible to a wider audience. “LIFT Aircraft is committed to revolutionizing recreational aviation and advancing eVTOL technology worldwide,” the company states, underscoring its dedication to introducing the public to this new form of personal transportation.

The upcoming launch at Expo 2025 highlights the increasing demand for innovative flight experiences. With the support of Marubeni Aerospace, LIFT Japan is poised to make HEXA an integral part of Japan’s push toward future-forward and environmentally friendly aviation solutions.
