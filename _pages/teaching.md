Throughout my master’s and doctoral studies, I have had the opportunity to work as a
graduate teaching assistant, which allowed me to engage in teaching and mentoring students. I
believe that students learn best by actively participating and attempting to solve problems using
their skills, prior knowledge, and experience. Therefore, I strive to create a learning environment
that encourages continuous communication, student inquiry, and critical thinking. My ultimate
teaching goal is to share and transmit my knowledge and experience, while fostering intellectual
curiosity and helping students become independent learners, capable of applying their skills and
understanding to pursue their personal academic and intellectual goals.

## Teaching Philosophy

I view teaching and learning as a dynamic student-teacher interaction, where both
contribute to a mutual learning process. I have found that one of the best ways to gauge my own
understanding of a topic is by measuring how well I can communicate that knowledge to others.
Teaching, therefore, involves not only guiding students through their learning journey, but also
using their feedback and success as indicators of my own teaching effectiveness. This dynamic
interaction offers opportunities for both teachers and students to grow, learn, and improve their
skills.
My teaching experience has primarily been as a teaching assistant for the “Analysis of
Engineering Systems” course at West Virginia University. This course teaches analytical,
numerical, and computational techniques for solving engineering problems, and requires students
to develop programming skills and work on code-based projects with written sections. I have
found that assigning multiple projects provides the students with hands-on opportunities to apply
lecture concepts, troubleshoot solution strategies, and implement numerical methods. As a TA, I
have been tasked with grading projects and homework, providing Q&A help sessions, and
monitoring student progress throughout the semester.
Additional teaching experience includes a summer study abroad program, where I
mentored and supervised 30+ undergraduate students working in 12 engineering companies
located throughout Queretaro, Mexico. This experience allowed me to engage with multiple
projects and provided valuable insights into mentoring students in practical engineering
environments.

## Teaching Interests

I am interested in teaching courses that align with my previous experience, such as
computer-aided design, numerical and statistical methods, engineering programming,
computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, and materials science.

## MAE 316 Analysis of Engineering Systems

Analytical, numerical, and computational techniques to analyze and solve engineering problems. Mathematical modeling, solution strategies, and analysis of results. Statistical techniques including probability distribution functions, regression analysis, and curve fitting.
