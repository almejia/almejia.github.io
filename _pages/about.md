I was born in Medellin, Colombia and have lived 17+ years in the United States. Therefore, I speak both English and Spanish fluently. I have a BS in Aeronautical Engineering from [Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana](https://upb.edu.co) and an aircraft private pilot license from [Academia Antique√±a de Aviacion](https://aviacion.edu.co). I am passionate about aviation and aerospace related topics.

My hobbies include practicing various sports including soccer, tennis, table tennis, and golf. I also enjoy traveling and discovering new places. This personal website shares some additional info about me and my academic experiences and research projects.
