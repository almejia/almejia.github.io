I was born in Medellin, Colombia and have lived 17+ years in the United States. Therefore, I speak both English and Spanish fluently. I have a BS in Aeronautical Engineering from [Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana](https://upb.edu.co) and an aircraft private pilot license from [Academia Antique√±a de Aviacion](https://aviacion.edu.co). I am passionate about aviation <i class="fa-thin fa-plane"></i> and aerospace  <i class="fa-light fa-rocket"></i> related topics.

My hobbies include practicing various sports including soccer<i class="fa-light fa-futbol"></i>, tennis, table tennis<i class="fa-solid fa-table-tennis-paddle-ball"></i>, and golf. I also enjoy traveling and discovering new places. This personal website shares some additional info about me and my academic experiences and research projects.
