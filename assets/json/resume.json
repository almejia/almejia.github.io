We developed a thermodynamic phase-field modeling framework and applied it to a model high-solute-content oxygen electrolyte Gd0.25Ce0.75O2-δ, wherein the microscopically measured GB-to-GB variability in defect concentrations was used to predict the GB-to-GB variability in cross-GB ionic conduction."
